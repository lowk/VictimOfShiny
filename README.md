# VictimOfShiny
Playing with Shiny using VictimOfMaths COVID19 code

A quick port of this script from Colin Angus to a Shiny server: 
https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/All%20Cause%20Mortality/LA%20All%20Cause%20Deaths.R

Generate plots of COVID19 excess deaths, deaths or case numbers by England, Scotland or Wales Local Authorities. Run by downloading all scripts to a directory, installing dependencies, and then running:

setwd('path/to/dir')

library(shiny)

runApp()
